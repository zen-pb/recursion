# Recursion Activity

This is a Javascript recursion activity from theodinproject. It includes:
- fibs.js: a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n<sup>th</sup> term using iteration.
- fibsRec.js: the same functionality as fibs.js, but using recursion.
- mergeSort.js: a sorting algorithm that uses recursion for dividing, sorting, and merging.
